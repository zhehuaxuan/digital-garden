## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial Quartz community plugin template.
- `disableBrokenWikilinks` option: when enabled, internal links whose resolved slug is not present in `ctx.allSlugs` gain a `broken` CSS class alongside `internal` so broken links can be styled distinctly. The check lives here (rather than in `ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown`) because this plugin owns link resolution and already computes the canonical slug.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (inherited from `@quartz-community/utils`)**: internal link resolution is now case-insensitive. Links resolve to lowercased slugs regardless of how they're typed (`[[MyNote]]`, `[[mynote]]`, `[[MYNOTE]]` all produce href `my-note`). Matches Obsidian's link-matching behavior.
